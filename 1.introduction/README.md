## What we're going to do today

![Hashicorp Cloud Platform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1662053773-dev-dot-product-landing-what-is-hcp-diagram.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_CSwmcYNinzt9r2MomNCMBBgKKqgK)

This will be:

- Part show & tell
- Part guided
- Part exercise

## Organise in max 10 groups

We're limited to 10 projects, so need to divide ourselves into 2 or 3.

Suggest to mix techies and non-techies, Macs and Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> All HCP projects should be empty except Project-1, it hosts a shared Vault instance.
